# Watto's Chance Cube Official Tournament Guide v7

_Official Rules and Card List for standard-format Watto's Chance Cube tournaments_



## Introduction and Rules

Watto's Chance Cube is a way to simulate sealed deck play, but with more familiar and powerful cards than a typical sealed deck experience would offer. The draft pool is composed of cards from the cube. Players receive a set of 10 "fixed" cards to ensure their decks can be playable. Players then draft from the Cube set card pool instead of the usual sealed product. Instead of getting obscure aliens from Jabba's Palace, or unusable interrupts from A New Hope, players are drafting from a card pool that contains Darth Maul, Mara Jade, and other usable cards to create a more balanced and enjoyable experience.

Instead of constructing a deck from randomized packs, the decks are constructed using familiar, and often times more useful, cards contained within the Cube. Players do not need to bring any cards to these events. All players will build their deck from the Cube brought by the Tournament Director.


### The Cube features the following:

* **Total draft cards:** 290 per side
* **Total fixed cards:** 10 per side, six copies of each, 60 total
* **Full cube total cards:** 350 per side

_Version 7 of Watto's Chance Cube features standard virtual cards. No legacy virtual cards are included._



## Drafting

First, players are randomly assigned a side of the Force to play (with each side having an equal number of players). They are then given a set pack of 10 "fixed" cards (listed below). Each player on that side of the Force will receive the same exact 10 cards (so you will need one set of 10 fixed cards for each player to have). Players then set those fixed cards off to the side and begin the drafting process, knowing that at the end of the draft they will be constructing their decks from their drafted cards and also their 10 fixed cards.

### Drafting typically goes like this:
Let's say, for sake of simplicity, that there are 10 total players in the cube event. The 10 players will be split into groups of 5, with one group drafting Light Side and one group Dark Side. Each player is given the corresponding set of 10 â€˜Fixed Cards' that apply to their specific allegiance.

The drafting cards are all compiled together and are shuffled up and randomized, then (face-down) divided up into 6 'packs' of 9 cards each will be placed in front of each player. Every player takes a card from their first 'pack' and then passes the pack to their left. This continues until all of cards in that pack are gone.

This process repeats, but now passing in the opposite direction, and so on, until all packs have been distributed and all of the cards have been drafted.

### Deck Building

After the sealed product exchange or booster draft is complete, players are given 10 minutes to construct their 45-card decks. Every player will now have drafted 54 cards. Using these 54 cards and the 10 fixed cards (for a total of 64 cards), each player then creates a 45-card deck. The remaining cards are a sideboard and you can swap cards in and out of your deck from between games.

### Re-customization

No other cards may be added to a player's deck from outside the tournament or from trading between players during the tournament, but a player may re-customize their deck between games with cards from the original stock of sealed cards. 

After playing 2 games with the deck, repeat the process with the opposite side of the Force.




## Objectives Expansions

The Objectives Expansion is an optional variation designed for more seasoned players and to help cube play more closely emulate that of constructed play.

Instead of receiving the standard pack of fixed cards to add to the cards a player drafts, each player wil receive two random expansion packs before beginning the traditional drafting process. Each player wil look through and choose one of the two packs and pass the other to the player to their left for them t keep. This will give each player their choice of three themes around which to draft and built their deck.

There are 15 Objective Packs per designation with most containing ten cards in each pack. Each pack that includes an objective will have all the necessary component's to play its objective (with an attempt for an option to flip the objective) and will also include commonly played locations associated with that decktype. Generally speaking, each pack includes the objective, 3-5 locations, stuff required for flipping, and 0-3 support cards.
