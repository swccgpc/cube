SWCCG Cube(s)
=============

## Background

* A **"cube"** is a curate list of cards that players can draw from.
* Usually there is a single copy (1x) of each card.
* The cards are randomized and deviced up in to 15 card packs to simulate the drafting experience. For those familiar with it, this is same experience as purchasing a "Draft Booster Box".
* Each player gets three (3x) packs.
* Each player opens one pack, takes one card, then passed the pack to the left.
* The process is continued until no cards are left in the pack.
* The process continues with the second pack, followed by the third pack.

## Tenets (Unless you know better ones)

* Format should be fun to play.
* The target for the the Cube format is both Current players, returning players, and new players.
* There should be enough possible strategies that every draft can feel different.
* Strategies for both sides of the cube can be different and do not need to be complimentary.
* The force should be balanced. No side should have an advantage.
* Total draft cards: 290 per side.
* Total fixed cards: 10 per side, six copies of each, 60 total
* Full cube total cards: 350 per side.
* Rules should be encapsulated within the relevant writeups and not link to, or require reading, forum posts to understand.
